Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because save points are going to be different depending on what logical changes are being made, it doesn't make sense to do so on
a set time frame.  Also, if done so automatically, changes make would need to be committed, requiring a commit message.
Even if a notification, or auto-save, popped up to ask for a message, it might not be a good time for said save/commit, negating
the reason/purpose for the commits needing to be one logical change, and thus, what message would you write?

It is better to have the power to save as needed, commit as needed, and then pull/push when commits are complete.
